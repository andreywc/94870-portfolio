## Debt-to-GDP ratio bar chart race (1995-2018)
As we see Japan having the highest debt to GDP ratio from previous charts, this bar chart race highlights where Japan is ranked among the other countries from year 1995 to 2018. The bar chart only includes the top 10 debt to GDP ratio countries for each year.

## Summary
In the first bar chart, we can see the countries that have the highest and lowest debt to GDP ratio at the first glance. The chart gives an overview about the values difference for each country. It makes us simple to notice that Japan has a relatively high ratio during that year. When we use our mouse to hover over the bars, we can also see the accurate value of the ratio. For the second grid of line chart, we can easily see the trend for each country. We can check how each country's ratio increase or decrease throughout the years. Some of the starting point may be later than the other countries since the data is not complete. 

In the third bar chart, we use the country that has the highest ratio for the most recent year in the dataset, which is Japan, and highlight it to see how the country has increased and decreased its ratio throughout the years. Though Japan ranked first till 2021, we only use the data till 2018 in the chart due the completeness of data. From the chart, it would be clear that actually Japan didn't have the highest debt to GDP ratio at first, but how the number rapidly grow among others throughout the years. This chart target audiences who want to see the trend of the country that has the highest ratio most recently. I chose this visualization as we usually are curious about the growth rate of the highest ratio country. In this interesting bar chart race, I think it will leave a deeper impression on the audience.
