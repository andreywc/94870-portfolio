# Final Project 
> *The project progress will be divided into three parts.*  
* [Part I](https://andreywc.github.io/94870-portfolio/final_project_andrey_chang.html)  
* [Part II](https://andreywc.github.io/94870-portfolio/final_project_part2_andrey_chang.html#part-ii)
  
## Part II  
### Wireframe and Storyboard 
### User Research 
#### Target Audience
The target audience of this story should be but are not limited to those who are interested in keeping a dog in the future. The concept that I am trying to provide is to adopt them instead purchasing them. But for the other groups, including people who may have already adopted or shopped one, they could also fall in the story and decide to adopt dogs from the shelters in the future.  

#### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
I asked through social media to investigate if there is anyone who wants to have a dog in the future. Luckily, there are plenty of people who are willing to have a dog. I approached two of the respondents and identified another interviewee who is already raising a dog for a more thorough response from different categories.
* Interviewee A, 27 years old, no experience
* Interviewee B, 24 years old, had a dog before
* Interviewee C, 48 years old, currently keeping two dogs
