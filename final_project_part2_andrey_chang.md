# Final Project 
> *The project progress will be divided into three parts.*  
* [Part I](https://andreywc.github.io/94870-portfolio/final_project_andrey_chang.html)  
* [Part II](https://andreywc.github.io/94870-portfolio/final_project_part2_andrey_chang.html#part-ii)
  
## Part II  
### Updated Story Outline 
#### Original Version in Part I
The debate of euthanasia of animals has continued for decades. In this project, I hope to persuade the audience to adopt animals instead of purchasing them to lower the euthanize rate. Adoption should be taken more seriously as thousands of pets are waiting for a new home. I want to tell more about the reasons why pets can be in the shelters, and in what condition will they face the scenario of being euthanized. 

* Story Arc:
  - Adoption rate needs to be increased to save more pets from being homeless and euthanized.
  - As a reader, I want more knowledge to understand how much pets are to be adopted or what can I do to help.
  - I can do this by adopting a pet instead of purchasing one when I am interested.
#### Updated Version
* Will be focusing on more about "adoption" instead of "euthansia" and "don't purchase" in the story, the two idea will still be mentioned, but is used to enhance the idea of adopting. 
* Will try to focus on the data of Texas, which has the highest euthansia rate among all states, to be more precise and narrow the story.

### User Research 
#### Target Audience
The target audience of this story should be but are not limited to those who are interested in keeping a dog in the future. The concept that I am trying to provide is to adopt them instead purchasing them. But for the other groups, including people who may have already adopted or shopped one, they could also fall in the story and decide to adopt dogs from the shelters in the future.  

#### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
I asked through social media to investigate if there is anyone who wants to have a dog in the future. Luckily, there are plenty of people who are willing to have a dog. I approached two of the respondents and identified another interviewee who is already raising a dog for a more thorough response from different categories.
* Interviewee A, 27 years old, no experience
* Interviewee B, 24 years old, had a dog before
* Interviewee C, 48 years old, currently keeping two dogs 
   
#### Interview Script
I showed them the storyboard without additional explaining, then asked the following questions:
1. What do you think the story is trying to tell you?
2. Are the data visualizations clear to you?
3. Is everything clear enough? Is there any topic or idea that seems unclear or vague?
4. Any other thoughts?

#### Findings
* Consistent Feedbacks
  - Positive: 
    - It is pretty clear that the story is trying to tell people to adopt a dog.
    - Great idea to appeal people with the dog picture.
    - Call to action on the last page is good.
  - Negative: 
    - The title of the home page, it doesn't seems that appealing and fells like I am trying to debate with someone.
    - Vague when talking about the reasons. Why did I mentioned reasons? What does the reasons here mean?
    - Things are clear, but maybe the order can be revised, like putting ideas about euthansia together

* Conflict Feedbacks
  - Visualizations are clear vs. Not sure why did I wrote Texas (Is there anything special about Texas?)
  - Information is enough vs. Not persuasive enough, especially if I mentioned the rate of dogs euthanized in shelters, this could be midleading 
  - Content warning label brings the attention vs. Add a subtitle under the content warning so audience knows what are you trying to warn
  
#### Changing Plans
From the feedbacks received from the interviewees, I feel like there is still a lack of information to tell the story.   
The following changes are planned to be made:  
1. New title to sound less aggressive. 
2. Include information about why the dogs are euthanized.
3. I was trying to simplify the story by only writing "Reasons", but because there are other information other than adopting in the storyboard, this further lead to a confusion. The plan is to change the order to see if it will be cleared.
4. The original sketch of the states will be added back, with a combination of the data of animals to be adopted and the euthansia rate, to tell why am I using the numbers of Texas.
5. Add subtitle to the content warning.
