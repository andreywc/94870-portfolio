# Final Project 
## Part I
### Outline  
The popularity of movies around the world have always been high. What is the most interesting genre that appeals you when you want to go to the theater and watch a movie? Does a higher rated movie earns more? There are many to think about when it comes to the movie industry. 
  
In this project, I hope to show information about the correlation about the "score" and the "gross". Moreover, does any specific genre earns more than the others. A blockbuster doesn't always mean it earns more. As a reader, I want to know more about the budget, the gross, the score, and other related data information that may potentially affect the audiences choices to watch a movie. 
### Sketches

### Data  
The data source is from :
1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies?resource=download)  
2. More to be found..
  
The plan is to generate a few visualization graphs from the datasets. There will be information about the relationship between the score and the earnings, the budgets and the runtime, or the genres and the runtime, and so on to find out what are the most interesting relationships among all data available. Different graphs will be presented to give a more comprehensive understanding.
  
### Method and Medium  
This project is planned to be done by **Shorthand**. The mapping of the data will be accomplished in Tableau or Excel.
