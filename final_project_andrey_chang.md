# Final Project 
## Part I
### Outline  
With the approaching of the traveling season, how much are you aware of the safety of your vehicle?   
  
In this project, I will show information about hot places where a theft may appear. Always stay alert no matter where you are, but if you are trying to visit some specific places with some specific types of vehicles, you might want to pay more attention. It is not to late to take action in protecting your property. The following categories will be covered in the project:  
1. Car type
2. States
3. Metropolitan area
4. Holidays  
  
I will be showing graphs to tell where are the locations with the potential higher risks. 
### Sketches

### Data  
The data source is from [INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-theft).  
  
The plan is to generate a few visualization graphs from the datasets. There will be information about the top locations where motor vehicles are stollen, frequently stolen types of vehicles, when is the most active time cars are stolen and what areas we may want to pay more attention about. Different data tables from the data sources will be combined to give a more comprehensive understanding.
  
### Method and Medium  
This project is planned to be done by **Shorthand**. The mapping of the data will be accomplished in Tableau or Excel.
