Public portfolio for CMU 94870 Telling Stories with Data

## About me
**Current student of the Carnegie Mellon University Master of Information Systems Management program.**  
  
Data visualization may sound like a simple idea to many people, but it is definitely an amazing work with incredible designs as it represents what the builder is trying to tell. I enjoy the experiences in exploring others tables, dashboards and charts. Someday, I want to bring the same influence to one using my own data visualization works.

## What I hope to learn
With my past experience working as a data analyst intern, I would like to dig in more to the field. I was inspired by how the visualization dashboards could assist others in their works, it feels like that the work that I did improved one's life by bringing them convenience, this was what brings me to learn more in this course. From the "basic" but critical things like colors and layouts, which we often ignore, to even more thorough knowledge when interpreting data. As I would like to continue my journey in the data visualization world after graduation, I believe the course will give me the strength to build a better understanding as a storyteller of data.
