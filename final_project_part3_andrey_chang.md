### Final Writeup
The feedbacks from all interviewees and the in class critiques were extremely helpful. I reorganized the order and figured in which way will the story be smoother and more constructive. There were also feedbacks mentioning that they don’t get why the maps, including the one about the adoption rates and one about euthanasia rates need to exist, which I found could be misleading and leads to an incorrect interpretation that the map is there just only to show the numbers. So I changed the order again with some words guiding the audience to let people be clear about what I am trying to tell.

After I published the shorthand story, I had several colleagues took a look at it. It surprised me that even people who didn’t have a plan to keep a pet also feel engaged in the story. They asked are there any things they can do to help improving the overpopulation situation or why does the euthanasia rate is still high even if states like California has a high adoption rate. 

Therefore, I targeted not only those who wants to keep a pet, but also those who are willing to help by donating or paying more attention to the situation. So for the call to action, I added some words to mention donating can also be a huge help to the shelters and also listed it as an reason for people to adopt instead of shop. 

I also noticed that when talking about euthanasia, adopting, and sending pets to shelters, there are always different kinds of sounds. So I tried to make the idea of “overpopulation” in the shelters clearer, by trying not to offend anyone no matter do they support euthanasia or not and no matter they think sending pets to shelters is right or wrong.

And to make the whole story make more sense, I also added an additional map about the numbers of pets entering the shelters to try to let people understand that places that have high euthanasia numbers is due to the overpopulation problem. 

It was grateful for all the people who gave me feedbacks and let me know what worked out well and what didn't. The idea of trying not to mislead and offend anyone from feedbacks was especially important. And when deciding the order of the graphs, paragraphs, and contents, we should think more broadly instead of just putting pieces together to make more sense. It was an extraordinary experience when developing the whole design of the story!

#### FINAL DESIGN OF THE STORY
The story starts with the title and a subtitle to give a clearer view about what this story will be digging in to. 

The main part starts with the map that shows the adoption rate by states during 2020. It is used to let the audience know that pets adopting happens everywhere and where are the states that are most engaged in. But the audience may be confused about the number, like the first time I saw them. If I didn't research more, I think I will believe that people are really engaging in adopting pets since the numbers look high to me. So in the presentation, it follows with the adoption rates throughout the country since 2017. Then we can see the percentage declining during 2019 to 2020 and even to 2021. So the map that was just seen before, it was 2020, meaning the numbers were relatively lower to the previous few years.

Following up, the story tells a number, 6.3 million, which is the amount of pets entering shelters each year, given such a high number, the audience could be curious about what are the reasons these animals enter the shelters. So the story will tell what are the most common reasons the lead them there. Note that the story throws a question about the percentage of pets spayed or neutered when entering the shelters to let them learn the fact of why this is serious. Then I design to let the audience know given such a huge number of pets entering the shelters each year, in what proportion are they euthanized yearly. Then I tried to let people understand why the pets could get euthanized, meanwhile, the "overpopulation" problem is one of the most severe reasons. At this point, I try to let the audience go back and see what bring them to the shelters by answering the question asked earlier.

Then I show the audience the map associated with the states that have higher euthanasia rates. Which I understand it could lead to the confusion of whether adopting really helps or not. Then I follow with an example where I luckily found data to demonstrate that the magnitude of the increasing and decreasing of adoption rates and euthanasia rates goes oppositely in a shelter in Pittsburgh. And then to clarify what happened to the numbers the audience just see on the map, I added a map of the numbers of animals entering the shelters in the year 2020, trying to make the idea of "overpopulation" more clear.

The story will then start with couple of reasons of why adopting can be better than shopping. I listed lowering euthanasia rate as the first one, as that was what I was trying to tell throughout the story, and mentioned again that people can help with the overpopulation issue.

Finally, the call to action states what I hope people can do if they are considering to keep a pet in the future or if they feel like they want to help solving the problem. I also added some links for the audience to be able to easy access to some nearby shelters and resources.
